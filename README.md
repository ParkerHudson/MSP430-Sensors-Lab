# MSP430-Sensors-Lab
This was a lab for my microprocessor class that required reading from three sensors (light, temperature, and touch)

The code turns and LED on when the temperature is within a certain range, this could be used for a simple air conditioner system.
The code also turns an led on when there is light present and when the touch sensor is touched.
